    "This application is engineered using React 18, leveraging Concurrent Mode for seamless rendering.",
    "The User Interface is built with Tailwind CSS, utilizing Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation for zero-bloat stylesheets.",
    "State management relies on React Hooks (useState, useEffect, useMemo) to ensure purely functional component logic.",
    "Data flow is strictly typed using TypeScript interfaces, preventing runtime errors and ensuring code reliability.",
    "The application features a fully responsive Grid and Flexbox layout system that adapts to over 5 different screen breakpoints.",
    "Theme switching is powered by CSS Custom Properties (Variables), allowing for instant, repaint-free mode toggling.",
    "All animations use hardware-accelerated CSS transitions (transform, opacity) to maintain 60 FPS performance.",
    "The 'Stories' feature mimics Instagram's logic using timed state transitions and overlay layering techniques.",
    "Images are optimized with lazy-loading attributes to reduce initial Time-To-Interactive (TTI) metrics.",
    "The routing mechanism uses the HTML5 History API, enabling single-page navigation without full page reloads.",
    "This project structure is modular, separating concerns into Components, Types, and Data layers for maintainability.",
    "Search functionality uses real-time array filtering with memoized computations to handle data efficiently.",
    "Accessibility (a11y) is core to the design, utilizing semantic HTML tags and ARIA attributes for screen readers.",
    "The codebase contains custom reusable components like Modals, Toasts, and Floating Panels to reduce code duplication.",
    "Event listeners for scrolling are optimized with 'passive' flags to prevent blocking the main thread.",
    "The application handles complex JSON data structures to dynamically generate student and faculty profiles.",
    "Scroll positions and navigation states are preserved using Session Storage and URL Hash management.",
    "Glassmorphism effects are achieved using backdrop-filter utilities, requiring modern browser engine support.",
    "The layout engine minimizes Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS) by reserving space for media elements.",
    "This entire platform is a client-side application (CSA) deployed on edge networks for global low-latency access."
